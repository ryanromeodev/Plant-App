# 🌿 Welcome to Plant App!

Indoor plants 🪴 are becoming everyone's favorite hobby these days – and for good reason! They bring so much relaxation and peace into our lives. But since these green buddies live indoors, they often miss out on maximum sunlight ☀️ and soil nutrients compared to their outdoor friends.

That's where **Plant App** comes in! We help you provide regular, timely food (soil nutrients) to your plants, ensuring they grow healthy and happy 😁.
